# Final-project - A New Fit

This project was made by Karoline Mann, Jenny Quach, and Rosanna Dahlberg - students at Technigo Frontend Developer Bootcamp, class HT21. 
By building an e-commerce website as our final project we got to use most of the skills that we had learnt during the Bootcamp. 
We decided that our e-commerce would be a type of website that the three of us would love to use ourselves - a marketplace for pre-loved children's clothes.

This is a fullstack project. The user can take a look at all products and also categories them, add items to a cart, proceed to checkout and "purchase" the items. 
By logging in, the user is also able to book a pick-up service to come and collect clothes that the user want to sell.

## The process
We started out by setting up most of our backend - the cart, user, endpoints and the product data. We also created a Figma design.
The next step was to start adding basic components and the structure of the pages. 
With all this in place, we could then implement all functionalities, connecting the frontend with the backend.

We used both CSS styled components and Material UI for the styling.

The website is responsive and tested in Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
